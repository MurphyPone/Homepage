<p><b>Apocalypse</b> -  A literary genre in which an author, usually pseudonymous, describes symbolic and often bizarre visions that reveal the heavenly mysteries that make sense of earthly realities.</p>
<p><b>Apocalypticism</b> -  A world view held throughout the ancient world by many, Jews and Christians, that claimed that the present age is controlled by forces of evil, which would be destroyed at the end of time, when God would intervene in history to bring in his kingdom. This event was thought to be imminent.</p>
<p><b>Apocrypha</b> - A Greek term meaning, literally, "hidden things," used of books on the fringe of the Jewish or Christian canons of Scripture. The Jewish Apocrypha comprises books found in the Septuagint but not in the Hebrew Bible, including 1 and 2 Maccabees and 4 Ezra.</p>
<p><b>Apollonius of Tyana</b> - A pagan philosopher and holy man of the first century C.E., reported to do miracles and to deliver divinely inspired teachings, a man believed by some of his followers to be a son of God.</p>

(Jewish cleansing rituals were repeated as the need arose; John’s baptism, like the Christians’ later, appears to have been a one-time occurrence.)  Later Christians assigned other meanings to the rite: the apostle Paul, for example, saw it as the mystical act of dying with Christ to sin.  See also Participationist Model.</p>
<p><b>Beatitudes</b> -  Literally, “blessings.” The sayings of Jesus that begin the Sermon on the Mount (e.g., “Blessed are the poor in spirit…,” Matthew 5:3–12).</p>
<p><b>Beloved Disciple</b> - Nickname for the “disciple whom jesus loved” in the Gospel of John, who plays a prominent role in the Passion narrative but is never named.  Older tradition identified him as John the son of Zebedee and claimed that is was he who wrote the Gospel.</p>

  <p style="padding-left: 25px"><b>Criterion of Contextual Credibility</b> - Commonly used to establish historically reliable material from the life of Jesus. If a saying or deed of Jesus does not plausibly fit into a 1st-century Palestinian context, then it cannot be accepted as authentic.</p>

<p><b>Cynics</b> - commonly portrayed as street preachers who harangued their audiences and urged them to find true freedom by being liberated from all social conventions. The Cynics' decision to live "according to nature" with none of the niceties of life led their opponents to call them "dogs" (in Greek, cynes).</p>
<p><b>Daimonia</b> - Category of divine beings in the Greco-Roman world. Daimonia were widely thought to be less powerful than the gods but far more powerful than humans and capable of influencing human lives.</p>

<p><b>Deutero-Pauline Epistles</b> - Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians, letters that have a “secondary” (= deutero) standing among the Pauline epistles because scholars debate whether they were actually written by Paul.</p>
<p><b>Diatessaron</b> - A “Gospel Harmony”produced by the mid-second-century Syrian Christian Tatian, who took the Four Gospels and combined their stories into one long narrative (Diatessaron literally means “through the four”: this then is the one long narrative told through the four accounts).</p>

<p><b>Divination</b> - Any practice used to ascertain the will of the gods. See also Auspicy; Extispicy.</p>
<p><b>Docetism</b> - The view that Jesus was not a human being but only appeared to be, from a Greek word meaning "to seem" or "to appear."</p>

<p><b>Epicureans</b> - Ancient groups of followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who maintained that the gods were removed from the concerns of human life and so were not to be feared or placated.  Happiness came in establishing a peaceful harmony with other like-minded people and enjoying the simple pleasures of daily existence.</p>
<p><b>Epistle</b> - Another designation for a private letter.  Some scholars have differentiated between “epistles” as literary writings in the form of a letter, which were meant for general distribution, rather than for an individual recipient, and “letters,” which were nonliterary form of personal correspondence.  This differentiation between epistles and letters is not widely held today, however, so that the terms tend to be used synonymously.</p>
<p><b>Equestrian</b> - The second-highest socioeconomic class of ancient Rome (below Senator), comprising wealthy aristocrats.</p>
<p><b>Eschatology</b> - Literally the “study of (or doctrine of) the end times.”  A technical term that is used to describe notions of what will happen at the “end” -- either the end of a person’s life or, more commonly, the end of the world.</p>
<p><b>Essenes</b> - An apocalyptically oriented Jewish sect, some of whom started their own monastic-like communities to preserve their purity in anticipation of the coming end of the world; e.g., the community at Qumran, whose members are widely believed to have produced the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>

<p><b>Farewell Discourse</b> - The final discourse that Jesus delivers in the Gospel of John (and not found in the Synoptics), chapters 13-16 (sometimes thought to include Jesus’ prayer of chap. 17 as well); this discourse may have been created by combining two different accounts of Jesus’ last words to his disciples before his arrest.</p>
<p><b>Firstfruits of the Resurrection</b> - A phrase used by the apostle Paul to refer to Jesus as the first one to be raised from the dead.  It is an agricultural image referring to the celebration held at the end of the first day of the harvest, in anticipation of going out to bring in the rest of the crops (the next day).  If Jesus is the “firstfruits,” then the rest of the resurrection (i.e., everyone else’s resurrection) will happen happen very soon.</p>
<p><b>Four-Source Hypothesis</b> - A solution to the “Synoptic Problem” that maintains that there are four sources that lie behind the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke:</p>

<p><b>Genius</b> - A man's guardian spirit (that of a woman was called Iuno).</p>
<p><b>Genre</b> - A kind of literature with specific literary features; in the modern world, for example, there are short stories, novels, and limerick poems (each with their own distinctive features); in the ancient world there were biographies, epic poems, general histories --and many other genres.  The major genres of the New Testament are Gospels (which are most like religious biographies), Acts (most like general histories), epistles, and apocalypses.</p>
<p><b>Gentile</b> -  A Jewish term for a non-Jew.</p>
<p><b>Gnosticism</b> - A group of ancient religions, closely related to Christianity, that maintained that sparks of a divine being had become entrapped in the present, evil world and could escape only by acquiring the appropriate secret gnosis (Greek for “knowledge”) of who they were and how they could escape. This gnosis was generally thought to have been brought by an emissary descended from the divine realm.</p>
<p><b>Golden Rule</b> - Found in Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount, this is Jesus’ saying that you should “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”  A similar teaching can be found in a range of pagan and Jewish ethical teachers both before and after Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Gospel</b> - When uncapitalized, it refers not to a book but to the proclamation of the “good news” (from the Greek word euaggelion) of Christ’s salvation (e.g., the gospel of Paul is his message, not a book that he used).</p>

<p><b>Heresy</b> - Any worldview or set of beliefs deemed by those in power to be deviant, from a Greek word meaning "choice" (because "heretics" have "chosen" to deviate from the "truth".) See also Orthodoxy.</p>
<p><b>Herod Antipas</b> - Son of Herod the Great, and ruler of Galilee from 4- 39 C.E.; this is the Herod who executed John the Baptist and who was involved with the trial of Jesus according to the Gospel of Luke (and the Gospel of Peter).</p>
<p><b>Herodians</b> - A group of Jewish leaders, according to the Gospel of Mark,  who were allegedly allied closely with the family of Herod and were thought, therefore, to be collaborators with the Romans.</p>
<p><b>Herod the Great</b> - Ruler of all of Galilee, Samaria, and Judea (and so “king of the Jews”) from 40 - 4 B.C.E; this Herod was allegedly ruling when Jesus was born, and is known in Christian history for killing all the baby boys of bethlehem in an attempt to destroy the infant Jesus (based on the account in Matthew).</p>
<p><b>High Priest</b> - Prior to 70 C.E., the highest-ranking authority in Judaism when there was no Jewish king, in charge of the operation of the Jerusalem Temple and its priests. See also Sadducees; Sanhedrin.</p>

<p><b>Honi the “Circle Drawer”</b> - A first century B.C.E. Galilean who was reputed to have done miracles and had experiences similar to those of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>House of Churches</b> - For centuries Christian communities did not meet in buildings specially built for the purpose, but in private homes.

Such communities, which met for worship, instruction, fellowship, and the celebration of rituals such as baptism and the Eucharist, are known as house churches.</p>
<p><b>Ialdabaoth</b> - In Gnostic tests, the name of the Creator-God (i.e., the “Demiurge”).</p>
<p><b>“I Am” Sayings</b> - A group of sayings found only in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus identifies himself.  In some of the sayings he speaks in metaphor (“I am the bread of life,” “I am the light of the world,” “I am the way, the truth, and the life,”), and other times he identifies himself simply by saying “I am” -- a possible reference to the name of God from Exodus 3 (“Before Abraham was, I am”; John 8:58).</p>
<p><b>Ignatius</b> - Ignatius was the bishop of Antioch, Syria, in the early second century.  He was arrested by the Roman authorities for Christian activities and sent to Rome in order to be thrown to the wild beasts in the arena.  On his journey to martyrdom, he wrote seven letters, which still survive.  These letters are included among the writings of the Apostolic Fathers.</p>
<p><b>Insula</b> - Ancient apartment buildings in which the ground floor was used for shops and businesses, and the upper floor was used for residences.  The apostle Paul evidently set up his (leather goods?) business and stayed in insula in the various towns where he evangelized.</p>

He was inadvertently killed during the siege of Jerusalem in the first Jewish revolt 66-70 C.E.</p>
<p><b>Johannine Community</b> - The community of Christians in which the Gospel of John and the Johannine epistles were written.  We do not know where the community was located, but we can reconstruct some of its history using the socio-historical method.</p>

<p><b>Judaizer</b> - A Christian who insists that followers of Jesus need to keep (all parts of) the Jewish Law in order to have a right standing before God (a view held, for example, by Paul’s opponents in Galatia).</p>
<p><b>Judas Maccabeus</b> - Jewish patriot who led the family responsible for spearheading the Maccabean revolt. See also Hasmoneans.</p>
<p><b>Judicial Model</b> - One of the two models of salvation used by Paul, especially in his letter to the Romans. The model conceives of salvation as a legal process, in which God, who is both lawmaker and judge, treats humans as “not guilty” for their sins (i.e., acts of disobedience) against his Law because he has accepted Jesus’ death as a substation for payment</p>
<p><b>Justification</b> - to be made right before God</p>
<p><b>Justification By Faith</b> - The idea that lies at the heart of Paul’s “judicial model.” A person is “made right” (= justified) with God by having faith in Christ’s death and resurrection, rather than by doing what is required of Jews in the Law of Moses.</p>
<p><b>Justin Martyr</b> - One of the earliest “apologists,” Justin lived in Rome in the mid-second century.</p>
<p><b>Kingdom of God</b> - In teachings of Jesus, the Kingdom of God (or God’s Reign) appears to refer to an actual Kingdom that will come to earth to replace the wicked kingdoms that are now in control of affairs, and of God’s people, here.  This would be a utopian Kingdom where truth, peace, and justice were restored; it would be ruled by God’s anointed one (i.e., the messiah).</p>

<h3><a name="chapter4">Chapter 4 - The Christian Gospels: A Literary and Historical Introduction to Oral Tradition</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Critical Dates: The canonical Gospels were all written in a 35-60 year range</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    </li>30 year gap between Jesus' death and the first written accounts of his life</li>
    <li>In that 30 year gap, various forms of <i>Christianity</i> spread like wildfire</li>
    <li>Jesus left behind 11 men and several women who spread word of his ministry, passion, and resurrection</li>
    <li>By 325 C.E., the whole Mediterranean and most of Asia Minor had a notable Christian population</li>
  </ul>
  <li>People believed that Jesus was going around saving people, strongly aiding conversion efforts</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>These stories about Jesus going around healing people after his death, being told by thousands were not historically true whatsoever</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Historical reliability and the phenomena of <b>Oral Tradition</b></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Kernels of historical truth embedded in Oral Traditions have shifted over time to fit the <i>needs</i> of evolving situations</li>
    <li>2nd century proto-orthodox Christians attributed authorship of the Gospels of to early, important figures to lend their stories credibility</li>
    <li>However, none of the Gospels make authorial claims excluding perhaps Luke</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>The majority of the apostles were uneducated, Jewish fishermen and tax collectors, who were likely not-bilingual or literate in Greek</li>
      <li>They could have been sources for authors of the Gospels though, through Oral Tradition</li>
      <li>The author of Luke states that the accounts have been passed down from eye witnesses → not very reliable necessarily</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Ancient writers were concerned with demonstrating <i>cosmic truth</i> rather than historical truth</li>
  <li>The gospels function as fables which provide a larger truth than what the actual text says</li>
  <li>Criteria for historical reliability:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Should not contradict itself,</li>
    <li>Should be generally plausible,</li>
    <li>Should be externally verified, preferably outside of its own [Gospel] genre</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All of the Gospels were written by Jews, and therefore the texts are heavily influenced by Jewish traditions, motifs, and most importantly the Jewish Law</li>
  <li><b>Passover</b> - The commemoration of the freeing of the 1st born sons of the Israelites via sacrificing of a lamb, sprinkling its blood on the doorpost, and eating a fast meal in preparation for the Exodus</li>
  <li>Judaism somewhat resembled a cultic devotion similar to other Greco-Roman polytheisms in that they would worship/sacrifice to a god (in adherence to the Abrahamic Law) to  improve their present life and satisfy the communal/household needs</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Believed in immortal beings in between them and God similar to Greco-Roman Daimonia : Cherubim, Seraphim, Angels/archangels</li>
    <li>Believed that God was known and knowable, but powerful and cultishly worshipped in Judea → “Jews” until military crisis saw the Jews driven out of Judea by Babylonians to Babylon, Egypt, etc., where they retained their religious practices until 600 B.C. → <b>Diaspora</b> = dispersion</li>
    <li>Still worshipped the 1 God of Israel, not a local deity, and exclusively of Israel via Abrahamic Covenant</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Fewer Jews in Palestine around Jesus’ life than after the Diaspora: ~7% Roman population</li>
  <li><b>Torah</b> = Guidance, direction → Jewish Law, was viewed as God’s greatest gift to his people, not burdensome</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Ancient Jews were committed to the Law because they had already been showed favor as God’s chosen people → the Law was their means of thanking God</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Pentateuch</b> - “The 5 scrolls”</li>
  <li><b>Septuagint</b> - Post-diaspora Greek translation of the Torah that was most widely used</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>LXX - Meaning “Made by 70” or 72 Jewish translators</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Most of the Jewish practices were considered normal for Greco-Roman religions, excluding circumcision and the Sabbath</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Nonetheless, Judaism was respected for its antiquity: Romans loved old cultures, religions, etc. (See Roman religion as a copy/paste of Greek religion)</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>The Temple of Jerusalem</b> - The central place of sacrifice and worship according to the Torah</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>500 yards x 325 yards, no mortar, 100 ft. walls; a tremendous engineering feat</li>
    <li>After the first Temple built under Solomon was destroyed, the second Temple's construction began in 538 B.C.E, and was finished in 63 C.E.</li>
    <li>Destroyed ~7 years later as retribution for the Jewish rebellion</li>
    <li>Meant to be the only/final temple to the God of Israel due to the presence of the <b>Holy of Holies</b> within → God’s dwelling place</li>
    <li>On the Day of Atonement, <b>Yom Kippur</b>, High priest performed a sacrifice for all the sins of the people</li>
    <li>Temple segregated to various inner-sections depending on importance/association</li>
    <li>Accounted for by the Jew tax to build the hugely expensive Temple by allowing for group sacrifices/worship gatherings → <b>Synagogues</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>Distinct from Greco-Roman places of worship by their uniform, Jewish purpose and inclusion of women and children</li>

    <li>Political and religious elite (high priests, composed the Sanhedrin, aristocracy)</li>

<h3><a name="chapter5">Chapter 5 - The Spread of Early Christianity</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Even though the Gospels were written long after Jesus’ death, they preserve some authenticity via Oral Tradition</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>All were published anonymously at first</li>
  </ul>
  <li>30 C.E. Jesus dies, 70 C.E. Gospel of Mark, 80-85 C.E. Matthew and Luke, 90-95 C.E. Gospel of John</li>
  <li>15-20 loyal followers after his crucifixion spread “Christianity” throughout the Roman Empire such that it became a world religion by the time the Gospels were written at the end of the 1st Century</li>
  <li>Converted not by sermons, but individually</li>
  <li>No mention of Jesus or his followers in pagan literature</li>
  <li>Stories likely told in Greek even though Jesus spoke Aramaic</li>
  <li>Oral Traditions were changed whenever they were cited in order to be relevant to new situations</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Focus on <b>Moral/Cosmic Truth</b> >> Historical Truth</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The differences in the Gospels are significant, but each conveys some emphasis about Jesus</li>
  <li><b>“Four Cardinal Directions”</b> - Four winds → four gospels</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>St. Irenaeus offered the first reasoning for the four gospels using natural reasoning</li>

<h3><a name="chapter6">Chapter 6 - A <i>brief</i> Overview of Roman Literature</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Form: poetry or prose, short or long, narrative or descriptive, etc.</li>
    <li>Content: nature or society, philosophy or mystery, etc.</li>
    <li>Function: inform, persuade, both?</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Greco-Roman Biography</b> - less concerned with factual data compared to impact, personality, behavior → fables</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>Based on Oral Tradition</li></ul>
  <li><b>Plutarch, Suetonius, Tacitus</b> - Authors of Roman antiquity</li>
  <li>Gospel genre put a huge focus on death of the protagonist → gives us the archetypal Christ-figure</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="chapter7">Chapter 7 - The Gospel of Mark</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The shortest and earliest surviving account of Jesus</li>
  <li>Depicts Jesus as the misunderstood Messiah, sent by God to fulfill his mission on Earth</li>
  <li>Begin’s with Jesus’ baptism by John the Baptist and ends with reports of his resurrection</li>
  <li>Used by Matthew and Luke as a source</li>
  <li>Starts the use of the term "Jesus <b>Christ</b>" = anointed one, meant nothing yet, so the original Greek simply stated that Jesus was the <b>Messiah</b> which was the equivalent</li>
  <li><b>John the Baptist</b> - Performing baptisms for the forgiveness of sins, dressed and ate like the Old Testament prophet Elijah</li>
  <li>After Jesus' Baptism, the heavens split open and the Holy Spirit proclaims Jesus to be the Son of God</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>The Title “Son of God” was not unique to Jesus → Hanina and Honi also were called Sons of God</li></ul>
  <li>Jesus is then thrust into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil</li>
  <li>According to Mark, Jesus is supremely authoritative: when he speaks, people obey</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Enters the Synagogues to teach and astonish with authority, not like the scribes</li>
    <li>Commands unclean spirits as well to obey → Healer</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Even with this authority, he is extremely <u>misunderstood</u></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Hated by religious leaders of his Jewish people</li>
    <li>Observes Jewish tradition, law, practices → ultimately betrayed by Jews still</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Jewish Scribes</b> - Literate elite who studied Sacred Traditions of Israel</li>
  <li><b>Herodians</b> - Collaborators w/ Herod → Rome</li>
  <li><b>Chief Priests</b> - Upper-class Sadducees who offered sacrifices in the Temple</li>
  <li>Jesus disobeys the elite teaching in order to help people</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>Eats with the unclean, “works” on the sabbath, etc.</li></ul>
  <li>Pharisees partner with their sworn enemies, the Herodians, and plan to have him killed for his <i>egregious perversion of Jewish Law</i></li>
  <li>Only God, Jesus, Demons, Mark, and the Reader understand that Jesus is the Son of God</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>“Do you not yet understand” - After feeding thousands</li></ul>
  <li>After healing the blind man in stages, the disciples gradually begin to recognize Jesus → Peter calls him “The Christ”</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>Jesus confirms, but says not to tell anyone about him → <b>Messianic Secret</b></li></ul>
  <li><b>Passion</b> - Greek for "suffering"</li>
  <li>Peter calls Jesus “Christ” as in “Messiah” as in delivered of Israel, does not understand Jesus when he says he [Peter] will suffer and die</li>
  <li><b>Messianic Secret</b> - of Mark → Jesus’ numerous attempts to keep his name a secret → for fear of misinterpretation of “Messiah”</b>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>Jews anticipated a strong, powerful kingly figure who would militantly deliver them from their oppressors (Rome), Jesus did not resemble this image of a Messiah</li></ul>
  <li>“Get behind me Satan” → Reprimanding Peter's focus on human grandeur (in accordance with the Jewish understanding of Messiah) rather than divine purpose</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>His disciples continue to fail to understand → he tells them they will suffer too</li></ul>
  <li>Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple, the Judgement of Man, and the Apocalypse are soon to come <u>in their own generation</u></li>
  <li>Mark’s Passion</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Jesus is anointed</li>
    <li>Last supper → prayer at Gethsemane → arrest → trial before the Sanhedrin → Peter denies Jesus 3 times → Jesus reveals his misunderstood identity as the Messiah → is charged with blasphemy → pilate charges him for treason, as he claims to be the Messiah → king of Israel ≠ Roman emperor</li>
    <li>Mark depicts Jesus' own uncertainty in his prayer at Gethsemane, the abandonment of his followers and betrayal: “My god, my god, why have you forsaken me”</li>
    <li>Temple curtain ripped down the middle, centurion acknowledges Jesus’ identity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>No historical accounts match this, however</li>
      <li>God is now free to all people according to Mark</li>
    </ul>
    <li>On the day after the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James, and Salome go to the tomb, see a man dressed in white, and tell no one out of fear, even though he instructed them to tell the followers to meet Jesus at Galilee</li>
    <li>Book ends → but later, scholars appended 12 more verses to smooth out the end</li>
    <li>Mark was not Jewish → gets some Jewish traditions wrong → but does it to stress the Jewishness of Jesus to demonstrate that ALL peoples are saved → written when the Temple was destroyed → misunderstood the reason for the destruction</li>

          <li>Lots of Mark + Matt ≠ Luke</li>
          <li>Lots of Mark + Luke ≠ Matt</li>
          <li>Not a lot of Matt + Luke ≠ Mark because they both have to get the same thing wrong in the same way to contradict Mark, but were written independently of one another</li>
        </ul>
      <li>When Either Matthew or Luke diverge from Mark, they have a very specific theological purpose for doing so</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>E.g. “Son of David” → Matthew highly emphasizes the genealogical Messiah</li>
          <li><b>Fulfillment Motif</b> - 10+ instances of “x was done in order to fulfill the scriptures/prophecies” in Matthew</li>
          <li>Mark  and Luke still link to scripture via “it was written”, but not to the same obsessive extent as Matthew’s <b>New Moses</b></li>

<h3><a name="chapter9">Chapter 9 - The Gospel of Matthew: The Jewish Messiah</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>"First" Gospel, widely treasured, shares 2/3rds of Mark</li>
  <li>Author was likely a Greek outside of Palestine writing in 80-85 C.E.</li>
  <li>Establishes Jesus as the<b>New Moses, the Last Prophet</b></li>
  <li>Stresses that Jesus is a man of Israel -- Matt’s Genealogy of 14</li>
  <li>Jesus is here to fulfill the Law’s intent → still very much invested in Jewishness</li>
  <li>Fulfillment citations - 11 Total, “This was done so that x was fulfilled”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus very neatly fits into Jewish history</li>
      <li>Jesus' message is not new, just a continuation of Judaism → the Final Prophet</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Matthew removes all of Mark’s Aramaic words and writes in Greek, but his audience is still Jews and Gentiles</li>
  <li><b>Jesus the New Moses</b> - Flees to Egypt to escape the slaughter of innocents → receives/interprets the law on top of a mountain → … → directly parallels OT Exodus</li>
  <li><b>The Great Commission</b> and Matthew’s Gentile Mission</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>“Go and make disciples of all nations and peoples” at the end of the book which opens up the mission to gentiles</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Unlike in Mark, everyone but Jewish leaders (and the 3 pagan Magi) recognize Jesus as the Messiah → perhaps to stress guilt?</li>
  <li>Jesus’ <b>Sermon on the Mount</b> - Jesus’ fulfillment of Jewish Law</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Beatitudes</b>  - Descriptions of those who are blessed</li>
      <li><b>Antitheses</b> - Jesus’ new interpretations of Mosaic Law → The purpose is not the detail, but the root meaning</li>
      <li><b>Golden Rule</b>  - Do unto others as you would have them due unto you</li>
      <li>Matthew offers a different interpretation of the Law than the popular, strict interp. → usually more strict, but also simpler than the Pharisees would want</li>
      <li>E.g 5:27 “Don’t commit adultery” → “Don’t have lust in your heart at all”</li>
      <li>Extrapolates the scope of the law from act to intent</li>
      <li>Matthew’s message: If you understand the very core of the law, then you will obey it.  Jesus is saying be better than the Pharisee’s</li>
      <li>Says the first 2 commandments inform the rest of the law</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter10">Chapter 10 - The Gospel of Luke: Exegesis of Good & Evil</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Believed to have been written by Luke’s traveling companion who also wrote Acts</li>
    <li>Written 80-85 C.E.</li>
    <li>Luke constructs Christianity directly in opposition to Satan/Demons</li>
    <li>Depicts Jesus as a prophet, like from the  Old Testament, to explain how Christianity spread from Jews to Gentiles too</li>
    <li>Four Verse preface is a standard Greek <b>Historiographic Prologue</b></li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Suggests that the topic was well researched and far superior to any previous sources, and the author identifies himself</li>
      <li>Makes an implicit, negative evaluation of Mark</li>
      <li>Says he is writing for “The most excellent <b>Theophilus</b>” → Lover of God, or perhaps a Roman governor in order to explain what Christianity is (not a threat to the state) → informed defense = an <b>Apology</b></li>
      </ul>
    <li>As a two-set volume with Acts, Luke traces the miraculous birth of Christ and his ascent followed by the spread of the Church</li>
    <li>Birth narrative is similar, but different from Matthew</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem for Caesar Augustus’s census in Luke, they return home to Nazareth right away, not time for a flight to Egypt or the 3 magi</li>
        <li>In both Gospels, Jesus is born in Bethlehem, and raised in Nazareth, but for different reasons (Temple infancy narrative in Luke vs. Old Testament parallels in Matthew)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jesus resembles a demigod figure, the pagan audience would understand his messiahship</li>
    <li>Luke has a <b>Dualistic Cosmology</b> : The Kingdom of God vs. the Material World</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Present theme in Mark and Matthew as well, but Luke stresses it more</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jesus sends out 70-72 disciples to preach and “Satan fell from the heavens like a flash [gradually though] of Lightning”</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Jesus defeats Satan in the wilderness, comes back, and begins to exorcise demons who ask “Have you come to destroy us?”</li>
        <li>He expels demons with The Finger of God -- From Exodus and only used by Moses and Aaron → Jesus is tantamount with Old testament Badasses</li>
        <li>Jesus doesn’t answer the demons, but Luke makes it clear that they’re afraid of him</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Everything bad in Luke is attributed to Satan → very Greco-Roman</li>
    <li>Sick? blind ? ill? → probably the work of  SATAN</li>
    <li>Luke repeats the practice of freeing people from bondage</li>
    <li>Very apocalyptic, but far less urgent than the other synoptics</li>
    <li>Luke’s <b>Two-Part Eschatology</b> - “End of the World”</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Kingdom of God is already here → Jesus combating Satan’s materialism</li>
        <li>Kingdom of God will come fully later ... not tomorrow though, as Mark thought → the Mission must be spread first</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Exegesis of Luke Chapter 11:14-23</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Satan is the Strong man and his property is the Material World</li>
          <li>Jesus is the Stronger man who strips satan of the fallacies and sin gave him dominion of the world</li>
          <li>Jesus is the stronger man, who frees people from bondage and ushers in the Kingdom of God</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Jesus’ birth is announced to <b>Zechariah</b> in the Temple, Jesus is born and consecrated in the temple, recognized as the Messiah by Simeon and the old Jewish priestess Anna</li>
      <li>Jesus spends CH 9 - CH 19 traveling back to Jerusalem to be betrayed, much larger portion than the other gospels → significant</li>
      <li>Luke also traces genealogy, but does so differently than Matthew, but both do so in order to show that Jesus is the Son of God</li>
      <li>Luke’s gospel begins and ends in the Temple</li>
      <li>Explicitly claims to be an anointed prophet of God at the start of his public ministry</li>
      <li>Jesus’ death is totally in control: “Father into your hands I commend my spirit”</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Less atonement like Mark and John where Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God</li>
          <li>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me” → concerned for others, but confident in himself</li>
          <li>Asks for forgiveness for those who are killing him</li>
          <li>“Today you will be with me in paradise”</li>
          <li>Luke stresses that Jesus was innocent → Centurion Longinus recognizes “Truly this man was innocent” → Archetype of a Martyr setting the stage for Acts</li>
          <li>Jesus bloody sweat was later added to corroborate Mark’s depiction of Jesus’ agitation</li>
        </ul>
      <li>For Luke, salvation is not brought about through Jesus’ death, but through the subsequent repentance for the miscarriage  of justice</li>
      <li>Author of Luke, Paul’s traveling companion wrote Acts too</li>
      <li>Describes the Temple heavily, God’s message comes through it, but the Jews reject it → reject Jesus</li>
    </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter19">Chapter 19 - Luke Volume 2: Electric Boogaloo - <i>Acts of the Apostles</i></a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Highly contested source for the reconstruction of Early Church History</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>According to ancient genres, Acts is written as a historical story → many of the speeches were probably made up</li>
      <li>Not to recount “what actually happened,” but the cosmic truth</li>
      <li>Similar in style to <b>Thucydides</b> - account of the Greek Peloponnesian war, or Livy’s <i>Ab Urbe Condita</i>, or Josephus’ <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i></li>
      <li>Limited objectivity due to the scope and importance of Oral Tradition which informed the stories → speeches were never part of primary Oral Tradition → always retconned to fit the occasion/character</li>
      <li>¼ of Acts is speeches delivered Paul and the Apostles</li>
      <li>Nonethless, it is the earliest source of anything in the New Testament</li>

      <li>Acts 16:9-17, 20:4-15, 27:1-28</li>
      <li>Passages are indicative of an eye witness → Luke?</li>

      <li>Verdict: inclusion of a “we” source</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Things Luke Gets right</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Luke’s topography is accurate according to the other Gospel accounts</li>
        <li>Social setting - he knows about/has sources that know about the specific/important cities like “Artemis of the Ephesians”</li>
        <li>Can name Roman officials/hierarchies</li>
        <li>Historical events like the “worldwide” famine</li>
      </ul>
    <li> Things Luke gets wrong</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Holy family having to travel to their hometown for the census → where they have no property/taxes??</li>
        <li>Just says so in order to fulfill scripture</li>
        <li>Herod dies in 4 B.C.E. → not possible for the holy family to be in a census under the reign of herod</li>
        <li>Next confirmed census was in 6 A.D.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Luke is telling the story that is important for the Early Christian Church, not the one that’s historically accurate necessarily</li>
    <li>Luke’s Jews reject prophets according to Luke, so Acts is the spread of the message to the gentiles</li>
    <li>Acts is a huge unitary claim to reconcile the idea of a Pauline/Peterine faction → NO there is ONE church, led by Peter, Paul and the Holy Spirit.  Luke writes it into existence</li>

  <li><i>The Gospel of Luke</i> was a Greco-Roman Biography about Jesus, the prophet, but Acts has no central character → more historical and canonical</li>
  <li><b>General History Genre</b> - Traces people and key events to present</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    </ul>
  <li><b>Thematic Criticism</b> - Understanding Acts through the parallels from Luke</li>
  <li>Acts is also dedicated to Theophilus -- which ties the authorship to Luke</li>
  <li><b>Pentecost</b> - Just as Jesus was rejected in his city, Jerusalem, as a prophet, so too will the apostles be rejected.  Therefore, go out</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Continued focus on on the <b>Gentile Mission</b> → “To the ends of the Earth”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Paul - The central character and the most notable convert of Acts
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Former anti-Christian who is chased out of Damascus by the governor, becomes a church leader, converts several major cities, is arrested by Jewish leaders, put on trial, and ultimately put on house arrest in Rome</li>

<li>Continued presence of “two men in white robes” from resurrection accounts</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Named at the Transfiguration as Moses (Law), and Elijah (Prophet)</li>
    <li>Pushes more fulfillment narratives</li>
  </ul>
<li>Parallel presence of the Holy Spirit who enables miracles and is present at the Baptism and Pentecost</li>
<li>Jesus is executed as a martyr, and so are many of his followers</li>
<li>Whereas in Luke: Jesus is Jewish, sent from Jewish God, and follows Jewish Law, Acts is about being a Gentile Christian</li>
<li>Acts is Luke’s “necessary delay” of the Apocalypse so that the church can grow</li>
<li>Acts is largely composed of <b>Apologies</b> - speeches of Christians to legal/religious authorities</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Main instigators of conflict in Acts are Jews</li>
    <li>According to the Jews, those who view Jesus as the Messiah have lost touch with their roots in clear violation of scripture</li>
  </ul>
<li>Peter cites a pair of psalms which predict the need to replace Judas as a member of the 12 → implies that this era of Christianity found lots of old scripture being fulfilled in their midst, even though it’s not at all clear how it's happening...</li>
<li><u>1st Theme</u> - God is behind the Christian movement → Jesus is the fulfillment</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Peter’s first speech is about how the 12th <i>has</i> to have been a witness to Jesus’ resurrection and all the way back to his baptism, but literally none of the remaining, original 11 fit that description...</li>
    <li>Peter implies that it is absolutely crucial to the propagation of the spread of Christianity → select Matthias → never mentioned again, crucial who?</li>
  </ul>
<li><u>2nd Theme</u> - Christianity as a continuation of Christ as a continuation of Judaism</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Speeches at the Council of Jerusalem regarding whether or not to circumcise gentiles → Decide that Jesus/God said that all are saved on equal grounds → Church leaders send a unified message to the Gentiles</li>
    <li>Luke writes Acts as a history establishing how Christianity is not, in fact, the fragmentary mess that is was after Jesus died, but in fact a uniform religion that shares common beliefs</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>According to Luke, the Christians are in agreement on every major issue</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Pentecostal speech from Peter -- Everything that happened is a fulfillment of scripture -- cites Joel</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Blames the audience for Jesus’ death → saved by his resurrection, they can repent and be baptized</li>
        <li>Jesus death does not bring atonement, but opportunity</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Paul’s mission ends in Jerusalem, like Jesus’ → 7 more chapters about his trials and his innocence which is not recognized by any of the authorities he is brought before</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">

  </ul>
  <li>Luke’s Jesus 	is the ideal martyr whose death is continued/paralleled by his Apostles in Acts</li>

<h3><a name="chapter11">Chapter 11 - The Gospel of John: Jesus, the Man sent from Heaven</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>“All things came into being through him” -- prologue</li>
  <li>Acc. to Plato there’s a distinction between “being” and “coming into being”</li>
  <li>Coming into being implies a beginning/time when it didn’t exist</li>
  <li>Jesus does not come into being, he always was, with God → pre-existent</li>
  <li>Jesus is very otherworldly and divine in John → “from above”</li>
  <li>John’s Defining Features</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Poetic literary style, philosophical, “high” literary style, excellent flowing Greek</li>
      <li>Miracles are more spectacular than in the synoptics → seven Signs</li>
      <li>Less action and more discourse e.g. CH 13-19 is a single speech</li>
      <li>Indirect authorial claim?  Introduces a possible perspective shift from the Synoptics → “Beloved Disciple caused these things to be written”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The Beloved Disciple - A member of Jesus’ inner circle, never explicitly name → believed to be John, Son of Zebedee</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus entrusts his mother to him, and he outruns Peter to Jesus’ tomb</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Nitty Gritty Chop-Suey</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Aporias</b> - literary seams, interruptions, shifts in the text which indicate a change in author/source</li>
      <li>CH 20: reads like an ending to the Gospel/source</li>
      <li>CH 21: geographical, temporal and contextual shifts → picks up with a song of Zebedee and keeps going</li>
      <li>Changes in Jesus’ style of teaching, the chronological framework, the characteristics of his miracles, and his opponents</li>
    </ul>
  <li>In CH 2: Jesus flips the tables in the temple, and from then on “the Jews” in general, not just the leadership, are plotting to kill him for the rest of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Very open about his identity, unlike Mark</li>
  <li>His 3 year ministry ends in CH 12, then he retreats to a more private ministry w/lengthy speeches → timeline slows significantly after his “retirement” in direct contrast to the flow of Mark which instead accelerates</li>
  <li>In the synoptics, Jesus teaches by parable, in John, he teaches by lengthy philosophical, abstract speeches</li>
  <li>His eschatology is much more ambiguous than the synoptics which had more immediate apocalypses</li>
  <li>Salvation rooted in believing in Jesus as the Son of God and communion with God, but not necessarily the Kingdom of God</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>A physical change must occur too: “You will become like the wind”</li>
      <li>Jesus says you must be born “anothen” → both : from above/higher, and anew/again → very clever Greek</li>
      <li>Jesus is the only one who explicitly espouses eternal life</li>
      <li>Do not conflate eternal life with the Kingdom of God which was thought of as a legitimate divine, but physical territory (to be delivered by the Messiah)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus waits 3-4 days to resurrect Lazarus to show that he can recombine body with soul which was unheard of in Greco-Roman literature outside of necromancy which was heavily frowned upon and was only a temporary “trick”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Different from the synoptics where Jesus is not a trick-pony</li>
      <li>Jesus is more than willing to perform public signs <i>in order</i> convince people of his divine origin</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Continues to argue with the pharisees and prophecies his own passion, likening himself to the passover lamb: “The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep” → “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” (10:2-11)</li>
      <li>With regard to his passion: “No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.  I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again.” → In control</li>

      <li>The crowd argues about what it was, even though Jesus said the voice came for the express purpose that they might believe.</li>
      <li>Still, many people, even leaders believe in Jesus, but are silent for fear of the Pharisees</li>
      <li>Even though he has established that he has the authority to judge, as his Father has the authority to judge, he says: “for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.” (12:47)</li>

<h3><a name="chapter12">Chapter 12 - From John’s Jesus to the Gnostic Christ</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Gnosticism was highly derivative of <b>Platonism</b></li>
  <li>Preferred the Gospel of John, but there was not much gnosticism in the New Testament</li>
  <li>Along with <b>Marcionism</b>, gnosticism was very popular and widely hated by proto-orthodox Church Leaders</li>
  <li>Before the Nag Hammadi was discovered, we only knew what Church Leaders wrote about Gnosticism in condemnation</li>
  <li>Gnosticism as a philosophy → <b>Redeemer Myth</b> - In the beginning was God, and all our souls were unified in him. Some accident caused the Gnostis fall from <b>Pleroma</b>, loss of memory, into oblivion.  So now we are suck in materiality.  From Pleroma, a redeemer, Christ, is sent who reveals the truth of our origin, allowing our spiritual ascent back to pleroma to abide in communion with God</li>
  <li>Characteristics of Gnosticism</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Metaphysical dualism → the spirit and matter are at odds with each other</li>
      <li>Physical world was created by an inferior God of the Old Testament, which is why the material world is inferior</li>
      <li>Brought about by cosmic disaster - the fall, evil God created all that is bad</li>
      <li>God is unknowable → a pure spirit who is so great that we don’t/can't even know</li>
      <li><b>Aeons</b> - Personifications of God’s capacities</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Also inhabit the divine realm with God as divine beings</li>
          <li>Reason, Will, grace -- personifications of virtue</li>
          <li>Last one, called <b>Sophia</b>, wisdom, who wanted to know the divine realm</li>
          <li>She falls, as she is falling, creating other Aeons outside of the divine realm</li>
          <li>Creates <b>Ialdabaoth</b>, creator of matter which is evil</li>
          <li>Ialdabaoth divides Sophia throughout human bodies</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Divine Spark - like the matrix, if you realize you’re trapped, you can be freed</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Requires Gnosis → divine K N O W L E D G E</li>
          <li>Divine Reader - Christ imbues salvific knowledge, but only for his Chosen Few → some people are just 0% spiritual, some can be saved through God’s work, and some with the Divine Spark</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>The Ascetics Ideal</b> - Trying to cultivate the Divine Spark, they lived like monks</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Reformed to a very diverse set of religions by the 2nd Century</li>
      <li><b>Sethian Gnostics</b> - understood themselves to be direct descendants of Seth of A/E</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Lots of mythology surrounding his divine origin</li>
          <li>Invisible Spirit - original, single, divine being, -evolved into an entire <b>pleroma</b> = “fullness” of other beings → the Aeons</li>
          <li>Trinity of Barbelo - “Mother of All”, Christ/Son & the Invisible Spirit</li>
          <li>Sophia births <b>Sakla</b> or <b>Ialdabaoth</b> - born outside of the divine realm → arrogant figure who believes himself to be God → OT God</li>
          <li>Goal is to return the divine power in souls back to heaven</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Valentinian Gnostics</b> - followers of Valentinus 100 C.E. of Egypt</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Much more merciful than the Sethian outlook</li>
            <li>Humanity needs to set free various elements of the divine via gnosis from Christ</li>
          </ul>
      <hr>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Johannine Epistles</b> (AKA the <b>Universal or Catholic Epistles</b>) - written by a later author of the Johannine Community</li>
  <li>After Jesus’ death, the community separated from the Church because they viewed Jesus as divine</li>
  <li>1, 2, 3 John are all very short</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>The author of 2 John refers to himself as the “elder” in response to the “elect” lady, but then begins to address a larger group → probably a Christian leader advising a large group</li>
    </ul>
  <li>John 3 was likely written by the same author due to the stylistic similarities</li>
  <li>2 and 3 are authentic letters, John 1 is less authentic → it does not follow conventional structure of intro, greeting, prayer/thanksgiving -- instead it reads more like a persuasive essay</li>
  <li>Probably the same author as 2 and 3 John, but is it the same author as the Gospel?  Probably not because they were written later than John</li>

      <li>Opposed <b>Docetics</b> = thought Jesus only “appeared” or “seemed” to be the Christ</li>

  <li>Christian communities had House Churches - much like how synagogues formed</li>
  <li>Johannine community developed Jesus to be comparable to God, not just a prophet</li>

  <li>We don’t actually know what the secessionists thought/believed, can only infer from what the author is accusing them of → not reliable</li>
  <li>John’s Community was not explicitly <b>Gnostic</b> - but they would have agreed with them on a lot of things</li>

<h3><a name="chapter14">Chapter 14: Historical Jesus and an Introduction to Apocalypticism</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The most reliable sources are the Gospels which are conflicting texts, written decades after Jesus’ life, in a different language, based on Oral Tradition which had been circulating for some time…</li>
  <li>Historians establish criteria so that sources can be evaluated for historical accuracy</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Numerous accounts that can cross-referenced</li>
      <li>Originated close to Jesus lifetime to mitigate exaggeration</li>
      <li>Produced independently of one another → no collusion</li>
      <li>Do not contradict each other</li>
      <li>Internally consistent</li>
      <li>Not biased so the subject supports author’s interests</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Pagan / Jewish texts before 130 C.E. that mention Jesus</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Very few, as if Jesus had 0 immediate impact</li>
      <li>0 mention in pagan texts in that 100 year span</li>
      <li><b>Pliny the Younger</b> - 112 C.E. Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus is the first to reference Jesus</li>
      <li><b>Suetonius</b> - Roman historian who wrote about Jewish riots around 41-54 C.E. which were instigated by one “Chrestu” → Christ</li>
      <li><b>Tacitus</b> - Roman historian, mentioned Christianity in his history of Rome, titled <i>The Annals</i></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Mentions how Nero user Christianity as the scapegoats for his burning of Rome → references Jesus’ death @ Pontius Pilate and the superstition that later emerged</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Very few Jewish Texts from this period at all</li>
  <li><b>Mishnah</b> - Rabbinic opinions on Jewish Law published two centuries after Jesus died</li>
  <li><b>Josephus</b> - Provided insight on the Jewish war against Rome 66-73 C.E.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Authored a 20 volume history on Judaism from the Fall in the Garden through to 66 C.E.</li>
      <li>Identifies Jewish high priest Ananus 62 C.E. who kills James “The brother of Jesus who called himself the Messiah”</li>
      <li>Identifies Jesus as the Messiah in volume 18 → potentially modified later on by a Christian scribe</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Christian Sources</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Non-canonical Gospels published through the 8th Century</li>
      <li>Little information outside of the New Testament can be considered Historical → most historical would be Paul who talks more about the cosmic truths than history</li>
      <li>Constrains sources to the Gospels, written 40-65 years after Christ's death, most of which source Oral Tradition...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Ranking Sources in terms of historical value: Paul, Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Josephus</li>
  <li>Must account for bias e.g. the <i>Gospel of Peter</i> blames Jewish Herod for Jesus’ death, slightly anti-semitic</li>
  <li><b>Criterion for Independent Attestation</b> - Negates the historicity of stories shared by the synoptics because mark could have lied, and both Matthew & Luke copied Mark</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Exceptions include Baptism stories which appear in Mark | Q  | John which are all independent of each other</li>
      <li>Jesus' Brother James appears Mark | John | Paul</li>
      <li>Seeds as a metaphor for the Kingdom of God  Mark | Q | Thomas</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Similarity</b> - If the history perfectly aligns with the theological motivations of the author, that’s kind of suspicious</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Passing an agenda via Jesus’ mouth (e.g. the gentile mission)</li>
      <li>Matthew very Jewish, Luke very gentile</li>
      <li>Problem with this criteria is that it’s very likely that they overlap: presuppositions of the author AND what actually happened can both be true…</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Dissimilarity</b> - More likely reliable if it can be shown to be different from the agendas of Judaism and Christianity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Best used to show what he did, not what he didn’t do</li>
      <li>Things that are not Jewish, because Jesus was reforming Judaism</li>
      <li>Things that are not Christian, because Christianity came after Jesus</li>
      <li>E.g. Jesus baptized by John, which implies his spiritual inferiority, why include that unless it actually happened?</li>
      <li>E.g. Betrayed by one of the 12</li>
      <li>E.g. Jesus hanging out with tax collectors and sinners</li>
      <li>Problem is that the things that are embarrassing/theologically challenging vary by culture</li>
      <li>E.g. “Let the dead bury the dead” --Q 9:60</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>It doesn't make sense for Jesus to say that, the burial process was very important, and it’s not a thing that Christianity lost from Judaism either</li>
          <li>Very Apocalyptic: You don’t have time to bury people, come follow me <i>NOW</i></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Problem is that Jesus was Jewish which is very similar to Px, so there’s probably a lot of things he said about which both agree</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Contextual Credibility</b> - Things that just don't make sense</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>E.g. the Gospel of Philip referencing Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist which were non-existent yet.</li>
      <li>Strictly negative application → used to identify things which did not happen</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Multiple Attestation</b> - More likely to be reliable if it is preserved in two or more sources that are independent of each other</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Most objective criterion → does not require interpretation</li>
      <li>E.g. Parable of mustard seed appears in the Synoptics and the <i>Gospel of Thomas</i></li>
      <li>Jesus’ sayings of marriage appear in Mark and in Corinthians</li>
      <li>Problem: lies could be injected into the Oral Tradition early on and there could be reliable things Jesus said or did that some authors didn’t like so they didn’t include</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Contextual Credibility</b> - Things that make sense in the context of what we already know to be true</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>E.g. Jesus’ discussion with the tax collector in Matthew 18</li>
      <li>Problem: Presuppositions about historical Jesus could lead to false conclusion and texts are always up for interpretation</li>
      <li>Also depends on which criteria is used to establish “what we know”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>What we do know about historical Jesus:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Galilean, born ~4 B.C.E</li>
      <li>Likely baptized by John the Baptist and may have been following him until he amassed his own following</li>
      <li>Wherever he preached, it upset the Romans and Jews</li>
      <li>Spent passover week in Jerusalem where he did something (likely in the Temple) which got him in trouble</li>
      <li>Arrested, crucified -- which is an exclusively Roman execution</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Pontius Pilate is depicted as a tool → passes blame to the Jews, but historically, he got in trouble for his excessive crucifixions…</li>
          <li>Rome gets antsy during Passover because it’s a Jewish celebration of their mantra that “God always liberates God’s people.”</li>
          <li>Jesus comes in talkin bout liberation → looks like a terrorist, so they kill him</li>
          <li>Jesus pisses off the Sadducees in the temple who go to Daddy’s $ → Romans</li>
          <li>The claim to be God would only have pissed off Jews, Roman was highly polytheistic → blasphemy wasn’t a crime to them -- it was because of the political dissidence he was stirring up</li>
        </ul>
      <li>This continues a trend of persecution spiking in 64 A.D. under Nero, as well as 250 A.D. when Germanic tribes were at the borders and internal Roman operations were crumbling</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Large groups of Christians refusing to worship/make sacrifices to Roman Gods for the safety of the state</li>
          <li>This posed a threat to the Roman state → easiest solution is to kill Christians</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Jesus likely spoke in parables</li>
    </ul>
  <li>How scholars understand Jesus</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>He was a <b>Man of Spirit</b>  - a social prophet/sage</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Jesus was non-Messianic → never claimed the title or his own agenda</li>
          <li>core value was compassion</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Prophet of Social Change</b> - Cared for the welfare of the people</li>

          <li>Entire ministry focused on relieving social maladies</li>
          <li>Came to mediate and manifest the Kingdom of God -- very Lukan interpretation</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>The Apocalyptic Prophet</b> - Most popular aspect of historical Jesus</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>John the Baptist → preached remission of sins bc the ends is near</li>
          <li>Heavy Apocalyptic tones in Pauline Epistles → earliest Christian texts</li>
          <li>Jewish Culture was a hotbed of Apocalypticism</li>

    </ul>
  <li><b>Apocalypticism</b></li>

          <li>The Messiah gathers and guides people to the Kingdom of God, namely Jesus</li>

          <li>Gives rise to apocalyptic thought, many Jews welcomed this because they wanted the coming era, the destruction of the Temple was an OBVIOUS trigger of the retribution of the Romans</li>

<h3><a name="chapter17">Chapter 17 - Jesus: The Apocalyptic Prophet</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Jesus’ preached an immediate apocalyptic perspective and message</li>
  <li>Both Mark and Q portray Jesus as an Apocalypticist</li>
  <li>Historically, we know that Jesus predicted the destruction of the Temple which is multiply attested in Mark and John</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>He calls the Temple a cult : “Den of Thieves” → similar to the <b>Essenes</b> who believed that worship of God had gotten out of hand and became ascetics</li>
      <li>Sadducees abused their power → Daddy’s $</li>
    </ul>
  <li>No need for the Temple when the Kingdom of God arrives → Jews would not have thought that this idea was very cash money</li>
  <li>12 Disciples → very apocalyptic number, fulfillment of the 12 Tribes of Israel</li>
  <li>Jesus’ association with tax collectors and sinners → Jewish leaders reject his mission, so he turns to those most in need of repentance in light of the imminent judgement</li>
  <li>Associated with women in all four gospels which reinforces the apocalyptic message “last shall be first and first shall be last”</li>
  <li>His exorcisms are multiply attested and not uncommon for a rabbi</li>
  <li>Jesus’ healings and removals of sickness are the manifestations of the Kingdom of God which is without imperfection</li>
  <li>All the these things portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet who foresaw the destruction of Israel/the Temple as a prefix to the entrance of the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li>In response to the <i>Da Vinci Code’s</i> claims of his affairs with Mary Magdalene</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Apocalyptic Jews (Essenes/Paul) were largely bachelors</li>
      <li>Every. Single. Gospel. Canon or not lacks any mention of Jesus’ spouse/ child implicated by the book</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus erases marriage in the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li>Sermon on the Mount stresses the reversal of status quo → get on board, relinquish your power in order to enter the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li><i>Confession is a manifestation of the Pharisees’ push for a status quo</i></li>
  <li>Jesus’ apparent rejection of family values:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Hate your mother, father, brothers, and sisters and turn to me</li>

<h3><a name="chapter18">Chapter 18 -
 From Jesus to the Gospels</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Jesus’ resurrection was his initial claim to fame, his message was only put on blast afterwards, via the gospels</li>
  <li>Christianity fundamentally was a belief in his death for sin, and his resurrection</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Different from the religion he espoused → Religion of Jesus vs. the Religion <i>about</i> Jesus</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Historically, Christianity begins with Jesus’s death and resurrection which sparked belief in his message</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>In some sense then, Christianity was founded by women</li>
      <li>All the Gospels agree that <i>some</i> group of women encountered the empty tomb</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>However, Paul, the first Christian author, does not mention the empty tomb</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Alternatively, the women are giddy and terrified -- unreliable, which is why their reports of the resurrection were not believed, explaining why Paul doesn’t mention them</li>
    </ul>
  <li>First followers of Jesus, Apocalyptic Jews, wouldn’t have thought his death was for sin, but that God had raised him to ascend</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Similarly, people who were believed to have been “exalted into heaven” were divinized - made into Gods : Enoch, Moses, Julius Caesar</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus’ resurrection influenced interpretation of his message → he claimed to be the Son of God, and referred to God as Father → strengthened his message</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Messiah → ruler of the Kingdom of God, which arrived with the Son of Man → obey his teachings about how to implement the Kingdom of God</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Before Jesus, no Jews believed that the Messiah would die for sins</li>
  <li>Jews understood scripture to be a personal revelation of wisdom for coping with life</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Psalms of Lament which speak about a: “righteous man who comes to suffer at the hands of God’s enemies and be vindicated”</li>
      <li>Not viewed as Messianic until Jesus’ death and Px spread</li>
      <li>Christians believed Jewish suffering in Psalms foreshadowed Jesus' passion → it was God’s plan the whole time</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Isaiah</b> - Wrote about the suffering of God’s righteous one</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>"Songs of the suffering servant"</li>
      <li>Died for the sins of people → atonement</li>

<h3><a name="chapter20">Chapter 20 - Paul, the Apostle</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>2nd to Jesus himself, Paul is the most important New Testament figure, authoring <i>half</i> the New Testament and spreading the Christian mission</li>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> adopted into the canon later than a lot of other texts only because it was attributed to him, though it makes no such authorial claim</li>
  <li>Paul was the strongest advocate for the gentile mission at a time when it would have made no sense people who were not “God’s people” could be saved</li>
  <li>Preached that Jesus died for the salvation of the world, not just Israel</li>
  <li>13 books attributed to him, but some were probably pseudonymous</li>

    <PRE>
    c. 36     - Conversion -- more certain date than others
    46        - 49 - First mission → S. Turkey
    49        - Council of Jerusalem
    c. 52     - Second mission → Asia Minor and Greece
    c. 5x     - Third mission → Greece and Asia minor again
    58        - Arrest in Jerusalem
    60        - Journey to Rome</PRE>
  <li><b>Pastoral Epistles</b> - Instructions to churches as to how to operate : probably not written by Paul, just written under his name to push an agenda</li>

      <li>Acts is accurate to Paul like Luke is accurate to Jesus</li>
      <li>Paul’s own letters greatly differ from Acts</li>

          <li>Paul says he didn’t his message was straight from God, influenced by no man</li>

  <li>Paul is preaching to Pagans according to Acts → They’re misunderstood about God being God of all → sinful out of ignorance</li>
  <li>Paul in Romans → attacks pagans for their willful idolatry and disobedience</li>
  <li>His letters are occasional, not thematic and mass-listed for all of Christianity to consume → we have no comprehensive Pauline theology, only the fragments he highlight in response to the issues in his churches</li>
  <li>He rarely refers to his own life, mostly the issues in his Churches</li>

    </ul>
  <li>We know that Paul never met Jesus, but he becomes the most influential apostle, and the rest of the 11 are understandably apprehensive because they don’t really know what his message is, but they know that he’s out there establishing shurches in Jesus’ name months after he was stoning those same people...</li>

  <li>Letters of Antiquity a genre</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Paul did not wish for literary publication, but did expect them to be read aloud by the recipient to a congregation</li>
      <li>His letters were treasured and ultimately led to the creation of books</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Structure of an ancient Epistle: </li>
  </ul>
</p>

I. <b>Praescriptio</b> - Epistolary prescript/greeting
  <ul>
    <li>“Paul to ____” or “Paul, Timothy, Philemon, and Titus to the church of ____”</li>
    <li>Unclear who contributes which parts where though, therefore the letters are simply attributed to Paul</li>
    <li>“Grace and Peace” → Jewish 'shalom,' but with a Christian shift because the Christian message is known as “the good news of the peace of Jesus Christ”</li>
    <li>Grace is a gift, not earned, from God because he is merciful</li>
  </ul>
II. <b>Thanksgiving</b>
  <ul>
    <li>“I give thanks to God for you and your faithful steadfast in the face of persecution” or whatever, in order to preface the theme of the letter</li>
    <li>Paul does this very meticulously in <i>EVERY</i> letter except in <i>Galatians</i> because he’s mad at them</li>
  </ul>
III.  <b>Body</b> - The text based on the occasion of the letter
  <ul>
    <li>His response to big problems in the churches he previously founded</li>
    <li>Sleeping with your step mother, speaking in tongues, the rich eating all of the supper, Christians suing other Christians, people eating idol meat, etc.</li>
    <li>“Pauline theology” is shaky because he rarely speaks comprehensively, just what the audience needs to hear</li>
  </ul>
IV. <b>Conclusion</b> - Short, personal conclusion, good wishes, closing blessing
  <ul>
    <li>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you always”</li>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter211">Chapter 21 - Thessalonians: the First Epistle</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The first surviving letter of Paul, written over 15 years before Mark</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Oldest book of the New Testament : ~49 C.E.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Audience is beloved to Paul, no real qualms prompting the letter</li>
  <li>Writing to a church in Thessalonica, the capital of Roman Macedonia</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Paul likely preached in synagogues to Jews and devout gentiles of the God of Israel</li>
      <li>Probably preached for a few weeks before antagonistic Jews ran him out of town</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We have no account from Paul though, just Acts... Paul just mentions the pagans of Macedon, not Jews and devout gentiles</li>
    <li>He probably preached out of his tent shop accompanied by Timothy and Silvanus</li>
    <li>Would have been received as ‘elite’ philosophers, as no other groups really did any 'converting'</li>
    <li><b>Insula</b> - Apartments in ancient, urban Rome → where Paul would’ve operated</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Open First floor design was reserved for business/socializing</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Convinced pagans to turn away from dead/false idols and towards the one True/living God</li>
    <li>Stressed the Son of God, resurrection, and his return (a foreign concept to pagans)</li>
    <li>Salvation by belief in the Son of God</li>
    <li>Transformed pagans into apocalyptic Jews</li>
    <li>Met in “House Churches”, semi-exclusive, distinct by worship to Paul’s message</li>
    <li>Private/voluntary participation was not uncommon amongst other cults</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Necessary to secure/fund burials of the members that would have been individually expensive</li>
      </ul>
    <li>1 Thessalonians is very personable and loving → most of it is thanksgiving</li>
    <li>Paul advises them not to engage in sexual immorality → keep image pure to the outside world</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Christianity was already getting persecuted → shunned for sorcery etc., no need to fan the fire powering persecution</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Major issue Paul addresses: loss of faith after members of the church community died before Jesus returned, so what happens to them?</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Paul responds, they will be the first to enter into the KoG</li>
        <li>Jesus comes for the living and the dead → but Paul expects to be alive when Jesus comes again</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter212">Chapter 21 - 1,2 Corinthians</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Corinth was like the Las Vegas of the Roman Empire</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Though this tarnished reputation actually came from Athens in a [successful] attempt to suppress the cultural authority of their rival</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Paul writes to them for their interpersonal conflict and ethical impropriety</li>
  <li>Condemns their one-upmanship of spirituality, lots of suing, and gluttony at the celebrations of the last supper</li>
  <li>Audience is primarily uneducated gentiles, but some elite diversity</li>
  <li>Declined their patronage → viewed this as “Putting the gospel up for sale”</li>
  <li>Appears as though enough Corinthians were able to take the Gospel message as a starting point and extrapolate upwards (sometimes incorrectly) unlike the Thessalonians who struggled with his basic message</li>
  <li>Never mentions Jesus’ baptism, transfiguration, preaching of the Kingdom of God, or Pontius Pilate → he’s writing before the gospels</li>
  <li>His principle message was of Jesus’ crucifixion, resurrection, and his second coming</li>
  <li>Unlike Thessalonians, Paul assumes the Corinthians have a working knowledge of Jewish Scripture</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Uses Jewish quotations to stress the omnipotence of Jesus’ message</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Calls them out for abusing the message to exalt themselves to glory</li>
  <li>Paul hears of their wrongdoings via Apollos → a fellow Christian leader</li>
  <li>Writes first to the people of “Chloe’s Congregation” - a wealthy, slave owning women, to address the factions that were forming as well as the criticism of his teachings he had received in previous letters</li>
  <li>Jesus after the resurrection in “<b>first fruits of Resurrection</b>”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Corinthians are not exalted in their present state as they have not undergone spiritual transformation - 'they are but demons in their quarrels'</li>
      <li>In thinking so, they overlook the very real dangers of evil in the present</li>
      <li>They speak in tongues in mass to elevate themselves over each other</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Deems marriage as the utility to temper sexual temptation, but if can you bear the gift of celibacy, do that instead</li>
  <hr>
  2 Corinthians
  <hr>
  <li>Follow up letter to the same community → indicates persistent religious issues</li>
  <li>Dramatic tone shifts present within indicate that it is a compilation of several letters</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>CH 1- 9 : good terms with the congregation → joyful</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Glad that they have repented for having treated him rudely</li>
        </ul>
      <li>CH 10:13 : Bitter and incensed, warns that he will come to them for a third time “in judgement”</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Addresses the Super Apostles - who perform signs → false apostles who cause disorder and disobedience</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Likely the second half was written before the first half in response to his initial humiliation</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Timeline of 2 Corinthians</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>1st Visit - Paul, Silvanus, Timothy → initial mission trip</li>
      <li>1st Letter - Lost letter mentioned in 1 corinthians - dealt with ethical issues</li>
      <li>1st Letter Back - Asking about more ethical issues, like can married people do sex???</li>
      <br>
      <li>2nd Letter (1 Corinthians) - Responds to their letter and conveys his plans to visit again</li>
      <li>2nd Visit - Apparently visited, but was treated really poorly, threatens to return in judgement</li>
      <br>
      <li>Arrival of superapostles - False prophets of Gospel who cause dissent → “ministers of Satan”</li>
      <li>3rd Letter (2 Corinthians, part 2) - Attacks the super apostles, Corinth is material and not glorified → does not intend to return again</li>
      <li>4th Letter (2 Corinthians, part 1) - After they apologize, Paul is pleased with them agains</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Believers will not be glorified until Christ comes again</li>
  <li>Paul Hopes to be glorified with them</li>
  <li>Unclear whether they ever got their act together or not</li>
  </ul>
</p>



<h3><a name="chapter22">Chapter 22 - Galatians</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlike Corinthians, Galatians follows a unitary message addressing a single problem</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Other missionaries insisting on following parts of the Jewish Law in order to be made right before God: namely circumcision</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Paul argues that this is not just unnecessary, but a misunderstood perversion of the Gospel message and an affront to God -- a rejection of <b>Justification by Faith</b></li>
    <li>He does not thank the audience, unlike all of his other messages</li>
    <li>“Galatia” is the large vertical region with cities in the South including Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe,  but it also stretched North for a ways</li>
    <li>Conflict between Paul and Acts → Acts says he founded churches in Galatia on a mission, but Paul said he merely converted some Galatians who nursed him while he was seriously ill</li>
    <li>“A person is justified before God by not doing the works of Jewish Law, but by having faith in Christ.”</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Parallels the Johannine message</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Paul begins by establishing his divine authority in order to refute claims that Gentiles must partake in the fullness of Jewish covenants i.e. circumcision in order to partake in the fullness of Christianity</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Those who have abandoned God by not trusting in Paul’s message are 'Cursed by God'</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Segues into an autobiography to further establish his ethos</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>A prominent Jew, approaching the upper limit of pharisaical distaste for gentiles and Christianity</li>
        <li>Also an inspired apostle → message straight from God → superior authority than Jerusalem</li>
        <li>Only conferred with Jerusalem to touch base, not to “get the story straight” and at the Council of Jerusalem</li>
        <li>Paul is vehement about this → “Before God, I do not lie”</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Takes offense at the notion that there is a difference between Jew and Gentile before God that the other missionaries seemed to spread</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>If the law alone was sufficient, then Jesus need not have died</li>
      </ul>
    <li>He includes a blessing, but no thanksgiving, because he wants to guilt them for the grace he mentions in the blessing → did they gain the Holy Spirit’s favor through Law, or by believing; through flesh, or through promise</li>
    <li>Faith, like the faith of Abraham, the Father of Nations, not just the Jews is superior to the works</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>The law says that no one can follow all of the laws, and those who do not follow all the laws will be cursed</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Adopts a Mattean response to the lawlessness that might follow the abandonment of the law that he seems to imply → “Christians are committed to each other in love → fulfillment of the Law”</li>
    <li>Paul sees some laws as very Jewish (circumcision, keeping Kosher), and other as natural/Universal (love thine neighbor)</li>
    <li>To circumvent the inability to keep all the laws, as the Law itself states → the Holy Spirit allows upright faith in God</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Those non-believers are “ruled by the flesh, not the promise of the KoG”</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="chapter23">Chapter 23 -  Romans: The Gospel According to Paul</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Longest and most sophisticated letter of the Pauline Corpus</li>
  <li>Closest thing to a summary of Pauline theology that we have → shaped Christian theology for centuries to come</li>
  <li>Writing to a church he did not establish, therefore it is unburdened by a solution to their problems, since Paul didn’t know them</li>
  <li>However, as his audience did not know him, his credibility/education is very important to give his letter authority</li>
  <li>Not writing to address a specific problem, instead preaching his interpretation of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Perhaps writing to them to ask for support for his Western Church → the Roman church was huge and important</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Writes to address their shaky perception of him (he who abolished Jewish Law?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Follows the ancient rhetorical style of diatribe → as a student of Platonic dialectic</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Advances a thesis and then disproves legitimate counterpoints</li>
      <li>Shows that the author has authority and is always right</li>
      <li>Romans would have appreciated the rhetorical style</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Writes to persuade his opposition within the Church of Rome about the truth of the Gospel message: Jews and Gentiles are equal in the eyes of God and equally saved by Christ’s resurrection</li>
  <li>“The one who is righteous will live by faith”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Part of his opening statement, likely comes from an early Christian creed as it is distinct from his usual style, but would be familiar to his audience</li>
    </ul>
  <li>First - Paul is not ashamed of the Gospel → he is very confident in it (from God)</li>
  <li>Second - Paul's Gospel is God’s powerful means of salvation → apart from Paul’s Gospel, there would be no salvation</li>
  <li>Third - Salvation comes to those who have faith → Paul demands <b>justification</b> (to be made right before God)</li>
  <li>Fourth - Salvation comes first to the Jews, then the Gentiles → Jews are the chosen people of God and his Law, but they are equal to Gentiles in terms of Judgement</li>
  <li>Fifth - The Gospel reveals the righteousness of God → God has not forsaken his covenant with the Jews, but Jesus fulfilled that covenant through his passion, so that all might be saved</li>
  <li>Sixth - Scripture proclaims the Gospel → cites Jewish scripture to the Romans who respected the ancient religion</li>
  <li>No formal Gospel exists yet, so Paul is referring to his own message which was revealed by God</li>
  <li>Paul’s models for salvation</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Judicial</b> - Mankind is on trial for its sins before God</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>The penalty is death, because god is Just → the human condition is death for its sins</li>
          <li>God is merciful (by grace) and Jesus is without sin, his death pays for everyone else's</li>
          <li>Grace is undeserved, unearned → through belief in the Death and Resurrection</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Participationist</b> - Sin as a cosmic force that must be escaped</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Sin enslaves people and Jesus Redeems (purchases) us from sin</li>
          <li>Jesus’ resurrection demonstrated that he was not subject to this force</li>
          <li>Baptism unites us in Christ, allowing us to participate in his death and Resurrection → Jesus abides in us</li>
          <li>Undergo a transformation of identity</li>
        </ul>
      <li>In one model, sin is willful, in the other its enslaving</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Flow of Paul’s argument</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Human condition</b> - Everyone sins and dies equally before God</li>
      <li><b>Divine solution through Jesus' Death</b> - Jewish Law focuses on sin, but proposes no solution.  Jesus’ death makes everyone righteous before God</li>
      <li><b>Gospel message rooted in Sacred Scripture</b> - Abraham was justified through works, obedience, and by trusting his faith → Christianity inherited this covenant</li>
      <li><b>The Death and Resurrection bring freedom</b> - Flesh is subject to sin which died in Christ</li>
      <li><b>A Law-free Gospel does not lead to lawlessness</b> - Self-sacrificial love in Christ becomes the new Law</li>

  <b>Summary</b>
  <hr>
  I.  Praescriptio - Opens with a warm Greeting to the pre-established church which foreshadows the main points to follow
  <ul>
    <li>His message conforms with what God has promised to Christianity</li>
    <li>Ties legacy to Judaism by tying it to prophets and scripture</li>
    <li>They’re obligated to spread the mission of Christianity and crucified Christ</li>
    <li>Those who receive it are undeserving, but receive grace nonetheless</li>
  </ul>
  II. Thanksgiving - Thanks them for their “faithfulness,” announces his plans to visit</li>
  <ul>
    <li>“One is justified in God by faithfully responding to his call"</li>
    <li>Through God’s grace we are justified, so we better just be faithful</li>
    <li>Playing it nicer to the Big Powerful Roman Church</li>
    <li>Paul's Pride and Joy is</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>his good news, mission</li>
        <li>that the Romans share it</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  III.  Body - Expression of Pauline Theology
  <ul>
    <li>Sinfulness of Gentiles - worshipping of created rather than creator</li>
    <li>Distinguishes Christians from Jews - yet there is no difference in Jew and Gentile in the eyes of God because of Jesus’ crucifixion</li>
    <li>God is knowable from the Natural Order by creation alone - creation is orderly</li>
    <li>Humans beings get fixated on the world itself, rather than seeing it as a reflection of God’s benevolence → inability to see past this world</li>
    <li>This leads to other sins: sexual immorality, idolatry, etc.</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Idolatry gives rise to every other sin: worshipping the world, not its creator</li>
        <li>This argument sounds very Jewish → who the Romans viewed as very traditional</li>
        <li><b>Paraprosdokian</b> - Pulls the rug out from under them “it was Christianity the whooole tiiime”</li>
      </ul>
    <li>People judging others - those who judge others are “storing up God’s wrath”</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Not concerned with individual hypocrisy as much as the group political claims → Jews are inferior, etc.</li>
        <li>God judges people by their deeds, not by their group identity, and he is impartial → Paul condemns judgement as badly as idolatry</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jewish judgement of the Gentiles - the chosen people have a high moral standard, but they don’t follow all the laws the espouse, giving them a bad name among gentiles → making God look bad</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Your actions can undercut your salvation</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Sin is a universal reality → no one is free from it because God is a just God</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>God serves death for sin → everyone dies</li>
        <li>If sin is the problem, God’s response is gracious justification opportunity through Jesus</li>
        <li>The Old Testament God is Just; and it's the same God in the New Testamnet, but he sent Jesus who was crucified for our sins allowing for mercy</li>
        <li>Humans are required to have faith in what God has done through Christ</li>
        <li>We can be redeemed (“purchased”, slavery connotation) from our oppressive sins. Bought back in Christ via faith</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Various models of salvation from Paul</li>
    <li>God’s actions via Jesus are full of grace in that we do not even deserve the opportunity for salvation</li>
    <li>Paul crafts a dualistic image of God</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>God is Just and we will die</li>
        <li>God is loving and merciful via Jesus whose death redeems our sins → faith is the only appropriate response</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="chapter24">Chapter 24 - Paul in Relation to Jesus, James, Thecla, & Theudas<a/></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Did Paul and Jesus represent the same religion?</li>
  <li>Members of Pauline churches certainly told stories about Jesus which could have eventually become the Oral Tradition of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Paul rarely says anything about historical Jesus other than:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Born of a woman as a Jew, had brothers, one of whom was named James</li>
      <li>Conducted his ministry among Jews</li>
      <li>Had a last supper on the night he was betrayed</li>
      <li>Knows what Jesus said at the Last Supper</li>
      <li>Knows that Christians should not get divorced and should pay their preachers</li>
      <li>Paul parallels some of Jesus’ teachings: pay taxes, obey the law, and love their neighbors → but he does not attribute these teaching to Jesus</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Things he doesn’t include:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Parents, early life, baptism, wilderness</li>
      <li>Kingdom of God, no parables, healings, transfigurations, cleansing of the Temple</li>
      <li>No interrogation by the Sanhedrin or Pontius Pilate</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 1 → no occasion to mention these things</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>He clearly knew the apostles would have been telling these stories</li>
      <li>Never mentions stories to converts because he opened with them in his mission → they would have already known them</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>However, most of his letters are reminders of what he already taught them...</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Paul had ample opportunity to use stories to support him, but he rarely did...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 2 - Considered Jesus stories irrelevant to his mission</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus' death and resurrection are of most import</li>
      <li>But he still cites Jesus often...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 3 - He just didn’t know enough about Jesus</li>
  <li>Nonetheless, he and Jesus agree on a lot: monotheism, covenants with Israel, Apocalypticism</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus still maintains Jewish Law, but Paul says no amount of obedience is greater than faith</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Paul thinks faith alone vs. James faith and works model</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Probably had different definitions of “faith” and “works”</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Thecla</b> - Takes Paul’s celibate advice to heart and ends her engagement to follow the Apostles</li>
  <li><b>Theudas</b> - Teacher of the infamous 2nd century gnostic <b>Valentinus</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Said to have been a disciple of Paul</li>
    </ul>
  <li>There were several sects of Pauline Christianity</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="chapter25">Chapter 25 - In The Wake of Paul: Deutero-Pauline Epistles</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Pseudepigrapha</b> - A work authored under a false name/somebody else’s name</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>A field of study for advanced students: forgery/imitation</li>
      <li>Sometimes documents were signed under their teacher’s name in an act of humility/attribution of the containing knowledge to that person</li>
      <li>Writing that makes an authorial claim, unlike the Gospels</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Homonymous</b> - A writing attributed to someone of the same name</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>John of <i>Revevelation</i> and John of Zebedee</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Deutero-Pauline Epistles</b> - Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians</li>
  <li><b>Pastorals</b> - 1, 2 Timothy, Titus</li>
  <li><b>2 Thessalonians</b> - most contested Pauline Epistle</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Claims to be written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy</li>
      <li>Likely written in the late 1st century, after Paul’s death</li>
      <li>Written to Christians who were suffering for their faith</li>
      <li>1, 2 Thessalonians are verbatim in several places, but have very split eschatologies</li>
      <li>Repeated insistence that Paul is the author, and that people should not believe in other texts written under his name</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Typical tactic of Pseudepigrapha: “don’t believe others, but I am true”</li>
          <li>Author discounts “whatever an earlier letter from ‘Paul’ may have said, do not be deceived” -- Quoth the deceiver</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Theological differences</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Delayed arrival of the Kingdom of God: “Do dead people go to heaven?”</li>
          <li>Uncontested 1 Thessalonians says yes, and they go first</li>
          <li>2 Thessalonians says: worldwide signs will indicate the end of days and the coming of the KoG: rebellion, lawless one revealed</li>
        </ul>
        <li>2 Thessalonians says Jesus will return to defeat the antichrist</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Pretty huge chunk of theology here, why wouldn’t Paul mention it elsewhere?</li>
            <li>The rest of Paul’s undisputed corpus says “the end is coming ASAP like a thief in the night” ← 1 Thessalonians </li>
            <li>Counter-argument: someone claiming to be Paul wrote to the Thessalonians saying that Jesus returned and the Kingdom of God is upon them, so they stop working because the full realization of the Kingdom of God is like 1 day away.</li>
            <li>Explains 2 Thessalonians authorial claim and the disparate ‘end of days’ theology, it’s like a clarification for them to get back to work</li>
      <li>Written to address those who thought that the day of judgement had already arrived</li>
      <li>Describes how they will know the apocalypse is here/coming</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Anti-Christ -- unique to 2 Thessalonians</li>
          <li>People believed it was so imminent/present that they quit their jobs and became a social burden on the rest of the Christian community</li>
          <li>1 Thessalonians says “it will come like a thief in the night”, 2 Thess says there will be several advanced warnings</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Antichrist</b> - A central focus of 2 Thessalonians which is not mentioned anywhere else but is a pretty big portion of this author’s theology</li>
      <li>So, who wrote 2 Thessalonians? Someone being persecuted as a Christian in the 1st century, either by a Jew or Roman</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Probably post 70 C.E., and they must have had access to 1 Thess. Bc of the verbatim agreements</li>
          <li>Perhaps saw himself as a Pauline Christian</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Colossians</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Written by “Paul” in prison, addressing the false teachers in Colossae</li>
      <li>Addressed to a church that the author did not found (explains why he had to claim Paul’s name for authority)</li>
      <li>Condemns the false “philosophy and empty deceit” → but does not specify what these teachings are, assumes his audience knows</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Some form of Judaic traditions: Kosher and Circumcision</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, therefore maintain your good Christian faith until he returns</li>
      <li>Writing style differs greatly from the undisputed Pauline Corpus</li>
      <li>Author says that Christians have died and risen in Christ, but Paul says that we have died, and are still awaiting resurrection in Christ</li>
      <li>Beginning of the instantiation of “household rules” that are not present in earlier Christian writing because the apocalypse was imminent, so it didn’t matter</li>
      <li>Insistent claim of authorship</li>
      <li>Hard to distill whether or not it’s undisputed because Paul never published a comprehensive theology as he usually wrote to address specific issues</li>
      <li>This author thinks: Christians “have already been raised in Christ”</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>But not a physical, literal resurrection</li>
          <li>Undisputed Paul disagrees AND believes in a physical resurrection → but it will happen in the future, not already, as the author of Colossians says</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Contains lengthy exhortations which imply a larger, more established church than the ones that existed/were addressed in the undisputed corpus</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Needs more rules, since we’ve been resurrected, and we’re now a bigger church</li>
          <li>Suggests a later time period than when Paul wrote</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Discusses <b>Judaizers</b> similar to those in Galatians</li>
      <li>Says that the requirements of the Law have been erased by the crucifixion, unlike Galatians which says it was only superseded</li>
      <li>Opponents in Colossae taught “worship of angels” and perhaps advocated a more mystical Judaism or even Jewish gnosticism</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Author says Jesus created other invisible beings (angels) for Jesus, and that Jesus is superior and only Jesus can grant salvation</li>
          <li>“Paul” is writing to curb this degree of Jewish mysticism</li>
          <li>Similar to Neo-Platonism which said that you can contact God through vertically networking the cosmos by intermediary lesser beings</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Author gives specific instructions based on class: wife, slave, poor, rich</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Paul never does that: God is impartial → Jew, Gentile, Rich, Poor, it don’t matter</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Christ hymn of Colossians 1:15-20 : "for in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell” -- Philippians is similar, containing the earliest Px writings</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Likely not invented by the authors, but were commonly included in thanksgiving</li>
          <li>Philip references a letter to the Laodiceans which is not present in the canon because it fucking sucks lol, viewed as the driest copy/paste of Pauline themes: “the most worthless piece of writing in Px literature” -scholars</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Ephesians</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Not really disputed that Paul did not author this book</li>
      <li>Very different style from the undisputed Corpus: very long sentences</li>
      <li>Very different vocab: lots of words that Paul uses nowhere else</li>
      <li>Writing from prison to a gentile Christian Church → not explicitly Ephesus</li>
      <li>Ephesus added later, the original was probably a circulated letter</li>
      <li>Overarching theme is that even though gentiles were once alienated from God, they have now been united with Israel as God’s favored people by Christ’s passion</li>
      <li>How to live in the ways that manifest this unity</li>
      <li>No specific problem that he addresses because there was no specific audience</li>
      <li>Super long sentences compared to undisputed Pauline corpus</li>
      <li>Works as good deeds, vs. works of mosaic law</li>
      <li>Betrays knowledge of Colossians (Spiritual resurrection has already occurred) w/many verbatim agreements as well</li>
      <li>Author of Ephesians concedes that he leads a more sinful life than what Paul concedes in his epistles</li>
      <li>Vastly different theology than the undisputed corpus as well</li>
      <li>Different ideas about Judaism in general</li>
      <li>Author appears to be a 2nd generation Christian, and refers to salvation in the past tense (as it has already happened), Paul contends that it is yet to come</li>
      <li>Ephesians establishes more rules for church hierarchies and refers to the Apostolic era in the past</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>PASTORALS</b> → undisputed that they are not Pauline, advice to Titus and Timothy as to how they should run their churches</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Focus on silencing false teaching and internal organization/operation</li>
      <li>Deal with church orders and an institutionalized church that did not exist in the 1st century</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Apocalyptic Christians wouldn’t have cared about church structure</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Different writing style and Christian vocab that didn’t exist until the 2nd century</li>
      <li>Different use of concepts and treatment of women than Paul held</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>“Faith” refers to the religion as a whole vs. Paul’s faith as a personal belief/response to God’s mercy through Jesus Death and Resurrection</li>
          <li>“Righteous” = moral, vs. Pauline “Made right before God” - which is more specific</li>
        </ul>
      <li>1 Timothy and Titus are almost certainly by the same author due to their united focus on Church structure and social dogma</li>
      <li>2 timothy is different but the style/structure is consistent with the other 2</li>
      <li>⅓ of the vocabulary in the pastorals is not found anywhere else in the Pauline Corpus</li>
      <li>In 1, 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses the entire church instead of the leader, simply because there was no explicit structure yet, so these don’t make sense</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>His churches were “<b>charismatic communities”</b>- congregations of people who believed they had been endowed with God’s spirit and gifts (<i>charismata</i>) → no one was in charge, except Paul, but he wasn’t there</li>
          <li>50 years after his death, with the apocalypse still not there, the proto-orthodoxy began to emerge, instituting official roles</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li><b>Bishop</b> = Episkopos = overseer</li>

<h3><a name="chapter27">Chapter 27 - The Christians & the Jews: <i>Hebrews</i> & Barnabas</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> and <i>The Epistle of Barnabas</i> explain how Jesus’ religion went from Jewish to Anti-Jewish in a single century</li>
  <li><b>Catholic Epistles</b> - 1, 2, 3 John, Timothy, Titus, etc. general epistles not written by Paul</li>
  <li><b>Self-definition</b> - How early Christians came to distinguish themselves from Jews → groups defined in opposition to one another</li>
  <li><b>Adoptionists</b> - Such as the Ebionites, believed Jesus was man, then was adopted by God</li>
  <li>Christianity continued to be driven inward, requiring conversion for admission via special rites such as baptism and Lord’s Supper</li>
  <li>To the Romans, Christians look like people who aren’t members of the pagan cult which prays for the welfare of the state, they don’t practice Judaism, but they worship the same Jewish God… looks like Px are exploiting a loophole</li>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> portrays Jewish Law as impartial and imperfect, highlighting its inadequacy as an Old Covenant</li>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> does not follow the form of an epistle, unknown author and audience, no thanksgiving or prayer etc.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Likely just a transcribed Sermon</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Part of the canon because 3rd/4th century Christians attributed it to Paul</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Not written by Paul: style, topics, theology are all distinct from Paul</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Origen</b> - Christian scholar of the 3rd century: “No one knows who wrote it :p”</li>
  <li>Audience are almost certainly persecuted Christians, likely gentile converts, not Jewish</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Author is writing to assure them that Christianity is superior Judaism, that it’s worth being distinct</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Different translations of Hebrews present very different christological views :</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus as wholly God, vs. Jesus as wholly man… depending on the placement of “of God” in translation from Greek…</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Themes of Superiority of Christ</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>superior to the prophets - they merely paved the way for Christ</li>
      <li>Superior to the Angels - they are the messengers of God << Son of God</li>
      <li>Superior to Moses - servant in God’s House, Jesus is God’s house</li>
      <li>Superior to Joshua - who delivered only temporary peace to Israel, Jesus grants eternal peace</li>
      <li>Superior to the Jewish priesthood - priests are required to mediate between God and Man for human imperfection, they descend from Levi - but Jesus descends from Melchizedek, who was honored by Abraham</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Additionally, priests must repeat sacrifices, Jesus only made a single sacrifice</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Minister of the superior covenant - God says the old covenant is not good enough, Jesus bears the new Covenant</li>
      <li>Superior Tabernacle - Christ raises his sacrifice to heaven whereas the Jewish Law is bound to the Earth</li>
      <li>Superior sacrifice - Perfect, complete, for all sins, one time only</li>
    </ul>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> author of Jesus is heavily reliant on Judaism if only to elevate Christianity above Judaism</li>
  <li>Argues that jewish law awaits greater fulfillment by God (similar to Matthew)</li>
  <li>Discusses how God makes old covenants obsolete in the Old Testament → the same thing happened with the covenant of the Law, obsolete in the face of Jesus’ death and resurrection</li>
  <li>The Old Testament Tabernacle and Jewish Law are inferior shadows of Jesus and the salvation he brings</li>
  <li>Once you have experienced the reality of Christ, there is no turning back, for that is like actualizing Jesus’ crucifixion, and then turning your back to him</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Harsh Old Testament punishments for turning away from the imperfect covenants… what would happen if you turn away from the perfect covenant: Jesus</li>

      <li>7th trumpet ushers in the anti-christ and his false prophets on earth</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>+7 more angels with bowls of God’s wrath</li>
        </ul>
      <li>The End comes with the destruction of the great “Whore of Babylon”</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>The city that persecuted the saints</li>
          <li>If <i>Revelation</i> is interpretted as propaganda → codeword for Rome</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Fall of the city leads to the battle of Christ and his heavenly armies vs. the forces of the antichrist</li>
      <li>Jesus rocks them → throws them into a pit of sulfur for eternal suffering, Satan is imprisoned in a bottomless pit</li>
      <li>Christ and the Saints rule on earth for 1,000 years</li>
      <li>Devil returns to lead some nations astray</li>
      <li>THEN comes the final judgement</li>

          <li>No suffering, evil, death, righteous dwell with him forever</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Revelation’s supernatural tone vindicates its supernatural character</li>
  <li>Alternatively, it can be viewed as a cryptic piece of propaganda urging persecuted Christians to resist Roman social constructs</li>
  <li><b>Apocalypticism</b> - Judeo-Christian worldview that contends that there are 2 components of reality: good and evil → everything falls into one of these two categories</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Present age controlled by evil</li>
      <li>God will come to bring the good era through judgement</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Daniel</b> - 165 B.C.E. - First Jewish Apocalypse → creates the Genre</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Daniel lived in 6th century B.C.E., but the book wasn’t around for 400 more years, so no wonder his predictions about the future were right</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Most likely written during the <b>Maccabean Revolt</b> when Jews were being attacked by the Syrians → to give hope in a dark period</li>
          <li>Uses past history to give authority to legitimate predictions by writing under an old old authors name</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Marked by themes of God coming to destroy evil</li>
      <li>Usually 1st person narratives of their revelation</li>
      <li>2 main categories:</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li><b>Heavenly</b> - A prophet is taken up to heaven and given a tour full of symbols: earth reflects a shadow of reality that exists in heaven</li>
          <li><b>Historical sketches</b> - The author has a symbolic vision of the future through a divine mediator</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Almost all ancient Apocalypses use a pseudonym of a famous religious figure</li>
  <li>Writing under OLD prophets/figures to “predict” things that already happened to give credence to their current predictions</li>
  <li>Characteristics of Apocalyptic Texts</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Bizarre symbolic visions - highly mystical, not straightforward descriptions, confusing even to the author himself requiring the mediation of the vision by the divine figure</li>
      <li>Violent repetitions - redundant, interrupting repetitions of key points</li>
      <li>Motivational Function - “God will save you and defeat evil” meant to provide hope to the people suffering</li>
    </ul>
  <li><i>Revelation</i> is unique in that it is not pseudonymous, just “John” which was as common a name then as it is now.  Not John the Baptist, or John Son of Zebedee, just John</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Nonetheless, barred from the canon for centuries do to its attribution to John of Zebedee → gnosticism.</li>
      <li>They are definitely not the same author though → evident through the theological differences</li>
      <li><i>Gospel of John</i> has no concern with the “end” and highly disparate writing styles</li>
      <li>John refers to the Apostles in the throne room, but does not mention seeing himself</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Historians think that parts of <i>Revelation</i> were written in the 60s, after Nero</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Probably not completed until !90, under Domitian</li>
      <li>“Babylon” refers to Rome as the chief political enemy of God</li>
      <li>Discusses martyrdom which was a late 1st/early 2nd century phenomenon</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Number of the beast : using <b>Gematria</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Some greek manuscripts write 616 instead of 666</li>
      <li>Nero in Hebrew = “Neron” = 666, without the additional n “nero” = 616</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b><i>Shepherd of Hermas</b></i> - 2nd century not pseudonymous either</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Part of the canon in some New Testament transcripts</li>
      <li>Removed because it wasn’t old enough according to the proto-orthodoxy</li>
      <li><b>Muratorian Fragment</b> - Sontains the dismissal of the Shepherd of Hermas</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Does not mention <i>Hebrews, James, 1,2 Peter, or John</i></li>
          <li>Accepts the rest of the Canon AND the “Wisdom of Solomon”, “Apocalypse of Peter” though</li>
          <li>Condemns forgeries attributed to Marcion by Paul</li>
        </ul>
      <li>5 parables, 12 mandates, 10 parables</li>
      <li>Driven by ethical concern, contends that a 2nd repentance is possible</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b><i>Apocalypse of Peter</i></b> - Pseudonymous, found in Arabic and Coptic → Nag Hammadi</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Accepted as canon by many in the 2nd, 3rd centuries</li>
      <li>Travels through heaven and Hell → inspired the Divine Comedy!</li>
      <li>To avoid eternal damnation depicted in hell, don’t sin</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter31">Chapter 31 - Revelation: 144,000 Male Virgins, Professor Lynn Huber</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>John is speaking to a male audience, calling them to be the best men they can be by offering an alternative image of masculinity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>'The Slaughtered Lamb' directly challenges the Roman paradigm of gender</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Greek “dulas” = everywhere else in Greek Lit. it’s translated to mean “slave”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Because of American history of slave language, the New Testament translations get switched to “servant”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>“Revelation” is linguistically similar to the word describing “lifting of the veil” at a wedding</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>John is very visual, commands the audience to look at things with him</li>
      <li>Removed from NRSV as it interrupts the flow, but in King James etc. John says “Behold”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Written in Asia Minor, 65-90 C.E.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Asia Minor is more obedient to Rome than, say, Judea → love the imperial cult because they’re distanced from the persecutions closer to Rome</li>
      <li>Emperors described as God-kings while they were alive, someone in Rome would have thought this absurd</li>
      <li>“Providence has not yet set in motion grace for mankind through Augustus, whose benevolence surpasses all” --Asia Minor leaders</li>
      <li>Imperial cult viewed Augustus as a savior, Council in Asia Minor adjusted calendar to center on his birthday → BIG DEAL</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>TIME HAS CHANGED TO REFLECT AUGUSTUS’S GREATNESS → the whole empire will know about him, they want him to know</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Massive statues, huge cult worship surrounding Roman emperors</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Rev Chapter 4 - describes “one who sits on the throne” and 24 other thrones seating elders who are loudly worshipping the central figure → laying their own crowns</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Challenging the Roman perception of their caesars, Rev begs the question “who rules the world”[not Nero/Domitian]</li>
      <li>Takes it a step further, emperors are evil → embodiments of Satan</li>
      <li>John’s audience really likes the Romans … his text “lifts the veil” on the evil of the imperial cult</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Roman culture heavily depicted the ‘ideal man’ and ideal masculinity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>They believed that everyone is potentially male, females just weren’t good/warm/external enough</li>
      <li>The way you become a man requires exerting your outward expressions of power/masculinity on others</li>
      <li>Inability to do so: born a woman, slave, low born, etc. → makes it harder to achieve perfect masculinity</li>
    </ul>
  <li>One of the places you could augment your virtue was the <b>Gymnasium/bath</b> house → especially in Asia Minor</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Sites of education, not just P.E.</li>
      <li>Where you became a MAN</li>
      <li>Usually decorated near the entrance w/their virtues and the prizes you can win by dominating in your field → strive for laurels</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Things that compromise manliness</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Being a woman</li>
      <li>Being penetrated</li>
      <li>Not being married with children → PUSHED Roman values</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Revelation challenges the idea that: you need to be a Roman man who makes more Roman men</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Say no! That’s the system of “The Beast”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Rev Chapter 2 - Jesus addressing the 7 churches of Asia Minor, the good and the bad using the same, familiar Gymnasium language: “The Son of Man promises salvation to those who are victorious” → Victory in Greek = “Nike”</li>
  <li>In Revelation, the image of success is “following the slaughtered lamb”</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Those who follow the lamb are 144,000 male virgins</li>
      <li>The lamb is slaughtered, but the lamb is also  the “Lion of Juda”</li>
      <li>Uses the same Roman language to identify the manly man of the story, but then tells a story that is completely contradictory to Roman culture</li>
      <li><b>Parthenois</b> - Girl who is about to get married → implied virginity, but not explicit</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>But they are about to get married to Christ</li>
          <li>“Don’t get married to have babies, reject the Roman system of masculinity”</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>The Purpose of Revevelation:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Demand devotion to God</li>
      <li>Cultivating the dominant culture in the context of the Throne Room</li>
      <li>Paraprosdokian - Flipping the Roman family ideal and sexual paradigm</li>
    </ul>
